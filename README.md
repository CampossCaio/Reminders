## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project is divided into 2 parts:

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you need to make sure that you already have the following tools installed:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
In addition, you need an editor to work with code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
and a running [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
